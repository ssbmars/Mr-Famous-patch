# Mr-Famous-patch
 A simple patch for all versions of Battle Network 6 that lets you play more than 3 pvp matches without disconnecting. It affects the Triple and Random Battle options and works with both Wireless Adapter and Link Cable modes.  

This patch was introduced years ago, but I never got around to sharing the source code until now. Because of upcoming improvements to the netplay method for Battle Network 6, this patch will no longer serve much of a purpose. It'll stay archived here for posterity.
